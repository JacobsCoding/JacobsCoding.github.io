            <h2>Interests</h2>
            <p>I am interested in lots of things including math, science, music and gaming. I am interested in math because I am good at it and have Algebra 1. Science because I really enjoy science and like the labs. Music because I love to listen to music. I listen to a lot of the older bands from the 70s, 80s, and 90s and because I might want to learn guitar. I am interested in gaming because at around age of 5 or 6 I got a Wii and me my brother and my sister always played Mario Kart and Wii sports and then we got DS' and we played Pokemon black and white and then we got an Xbox one and now I play Call of Duty and Rainbow six and other FPS games and I have so much fun playing with my brother and friends on the xbox and enjoy these games.</p>

            <h2>Family</h2>
            <p>My Mom was born in Geogria in 1969 and my Dad was born here in California in 1964. They got married around 1997 in March and then in 2003 on September 26 my brother, my sister, and I were born. When I was born I was born I believe 5 months early and was so small, so small that my dad's wedding ring could fit all the way up my arm. I am sure glad to be here alive from being so small to being in middle school.</p>
